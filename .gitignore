# --- Build Artifacts ---

*.gcno # GCC coverage
*.gcda # GCC coverage
*.gcov # GCC coverage
*.dll.config
*.exe.config

# --- NuGet Packages ---
## NuGet packages folder (older .NET Framework style, good to keep for compatibility)

## Exclude C# project packages directory
*.nuget.props
*.nuget.targets
## Don't ignore packages.config (used by older .NET Framework projects)
!**/packages.config
## NuGet Package Lock Files (project.assets.json is in obj/ and already ignored)

*.log
# Entity Framework Migrations backup
MigrationBackup/
